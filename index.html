<title>the wibsite</title>

<o>A slick puddle on the floor of a nightclub in Berlin (somewhere), reflecting the Light of Many Colors. Near a small village on the Sapphire Coast, a fisherman dips his hook into the water for the first time that morning, and in the gentle motion of the waves, he does not notice that no ripples emerge. A old tome on the top shelf of a study in an winemaker's estate in the Alto Maipo gathers another few particles of dust, bringing it nearer to the day (some 25 years later) when it will topple off, falling 11.4 meters to the ground (don't worry, nobody will even be in the room).</p>
<p>Wait - in the distance - what's that? The birth of a new style of electronic music? The cry of an alien bird? The shouts of the harvesters, taking a break from their labor to engage in an athletic contest or - no, surely not - a knife fight?</p>
<p>That was the moment we knew.</p>
